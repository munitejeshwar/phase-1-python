Day 2 Notes

What I learned:
- Mainly learned to know logic before the code for better understanding
- How if/else works
- How loops repeat work
- How functions reuse code


One thing clear:
- Hashmap is used in valid anagram 242.leetcode and understood logic clearly 
- completed written code without copying after many errors.
- 60% confidence to do again after a week but 100% confidence on logic.
